# Angular-projects
A repository with multiple simple Angular projects to get familiar with the Angular framework.

Each branch contains a different Angular projects. 
The idea is to create atleast 5 to 10 simple applications using the Angular framework. 
At the moment, all projects are planned to be created using NgModule workflow. Standalone component are little bit scary to start with...

Feel free to contact me at @florianlernould7.gmail.com to advise any of my projects.
These projects can also be used freely.
